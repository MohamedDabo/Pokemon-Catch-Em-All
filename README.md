# Pokemon-Catch-Em-All
In this project, I explored the world of Pokemon. Having grown up with the series, I thought it would be a good idea to analyze this dataset found on Kaggle.

First I took a look at the different types of pokemon, then I digged a little deeper into battle performances by answering the following questions:

    1. Who has the highest Combat Power (CP)?
    2. Who has the lowest Combat Power (CP)?
    3. Who has the highest Hit Points (HP)?
    4. Who has the lowest Hit Points (HP)?
    5. Who is the strongest Pokemon?
